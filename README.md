experiments in finetuning language models


This "live" repository contains experimental work on finetuning language models (LM). 

The focus is on decoder-only transformers (see selected models). 

Its structure may/will change over time but for now it is organized around 4 topics 

[1] Inference 
 
 with scripts on efficient generation of text from LM 
 
 [2] Fine Tuning 
 
 experimenting with fine tuning language models 
 
 [3] Evaluation 
 
 experimenting with the evaluation of language models 
 
 [4] others
