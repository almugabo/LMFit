# Focus on decoder models 

Simply put, a language model (LM) is a mathematical representation of (written) words and the relationships between them. 

[N.B: words here have to be understood in a wider sense as to include also other language symbols such as punctuation, space ...). 

LM came in different flavors. 

Our focus in this repo will be mainly on (transformer-based) decoder-only LM
